## WeMix API

WeMix is an app that enables users to build their own music video library. Built with [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and Ruby. The test suite was built using [RSpec](https://rspec.info/).

## Motivation
This project was built as part of final project requirements for Flatiron School and to build something fun. I enjoy music and, knowing it's not just me, thought I'd create an app that allows users to search for and play music videos. You can find the WeMix front end [here](https://github.com/kkterai/we-mix-app).
