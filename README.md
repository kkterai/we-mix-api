# WeMix API

## Motivation
This project was built to both fulfill final project requirements for Flatiron School and to build something fun. I enjoy music and, knowing it's not just me, thought I'd create an app that allows users to search for and play music videos.

## Tech Specs
* The API was built using Rails V. 5.1.1
* It uses a PostgreSQL database.
* The test suite was built using RSpec.
